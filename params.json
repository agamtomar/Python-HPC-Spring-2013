{"name":"Python HPC Tutorials","tagline":"Example code and slides","body":"### Learn Python for High Performace Computing.\r\nThis is a series of lectures and examples for using python for scientific computing on a high performance cluster.  During the school year, we give these lectures at the Univeristy of Colorado.  Please follow us on [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/University-of-Colorado-Computational-Science-and-Engineering/) to stay connected and learn more.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Topics\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
